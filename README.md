This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: unexpected TypeErrors during array processing.  The `bug.php` file contains a function that attempts to sum an array containing a string value. This will throw an error. The `bugSolution.php` file shows the correct implementation with added input validation to prevent this error.  The improved function handles non-numeric array elements gracefully, either by throwing an informative error or by skipping them, making the code more robust.
